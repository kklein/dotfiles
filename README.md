# configs
Repo for diverse configs.

The config files remain in their sought-after location. They are symlinked into the folder of the repository. This makes it easier to keep track of what is part of the repository.

Currently included: 

- i3 config file
  actual path: ~/.config/i3/config
- Xmodmap file (mapping keystrokes at a low level, e.g. used for remapping of caps lock and left alt)
  ~/.Xmodmap
